According to guidelines from the Inland Revenue Board of Malaysia (IRBM), also known as Lembaga Hasil Dalam Negeri Malaysia (LHDNM), each invoice submission requires a digital signature. Whether submitting a single invoice or a batch, every individual invoice must be digitally signed to comply with regulations.\r\n\r\n# Let\u2019s explore the digital signature process in more detail:\r\n\r\n## What is a Digital Signature?\r\n\r\nA digital signature acts as a virtual seal, uniquely linking digital information to its creator. Similar to a handwritten signature or a stamped seal in the physical world, a digital signature offers enhanced security and reliability in the digital realm.\r\n\r\nA digital signature consists of two key components: a private key and a public key. These keys are mathematically linked through asymmetric encryption algorithms such as RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) or ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography), ensuring that data encrypted with one key can only be decrypted with the other.\r\n\r\n### Importance and Applications of Digital Signatures:\r\n\r\n- Authentication: Digital signatures authenticate the sender's identity, ensuring the message or document originates from a legitimate source.\r\n- Integrity: Digital signatures detect any alterations or tampering attempts, ensuring the integrity of transmitted data.\r\n- Non-repudiation: Once a document is digitally signed, the sender cannot deny their involvement or repudiate the contents, providing irrefutable proof of their consent or authorization.\r\n- Legal Validity: In many jurisdictions, digital signatures hold the same legal validity as handwritten signatures, facilitating the execution of contracts, agreements, and other legally binding documents electronically.\r\n\r\n## The Role of Certificate Authorities (CAs):\r\n\r\nCertificate Authorities (CAs) are crucial in validating digital signatures by providing a trusted framework for verifying the authenticity and legitimacy of public keys associated with digital certificates. Here's how CAs facilitate the validation process:\r\n\r\n- Issuance of Digital Certificates: CAs issue digital certificates, electronic credentials that bind an individual or entity's identity to a public key.\r\n- Verification of Identity: CAs rigorously verify the identity of the requesting entity before issuing a digital certificate.\r\n- Binding Public Keys to Identities: After identity verification, the CA digitally signs the digital certificate, attesting that the public key is associated with the verified identity.\r\n- Distribution of Certificates: CAs make digital certificates publicly available through online repositories, enabling relying parties to access and verify certificate validity.\r\n- Validation of Digital Signatures: Recipients extract the digital signature and the signer's digital certificate to verify authenticity using the CA's public key.\r\n- Trust Chain Verification: Recipients can recursively validate the certificate chain to ensure each certificate is valid and issued by a trusted CA.\r\n\r\n## How it Works for e-Invoicing in Malaysia:\r\n\r\n1. Generating e-Invoices: Taxpayers or e-Invoice intermediaries generate e-Invoices in XML or JSON format.\r\n2. Hash Calculation: Using the SHA 256 algorithm, calculate the hash value of the e-Invoice.\r\n3. Digital Signature: Digitally sign the hash of the invoice with the digital certificate.\r\n4. Invoice Submission: Include the signature value in the e-Invoice XML/JSON and submit it to IRBM/LHDNM APIs.\r\n\r\n## Validating Digital Signatures by IRBM/LHDNM:\r\n\r\n1. Decryption and Identification: IRBM decrypts the signature value using the taxpayer's public key and identifies the hash value.\r\n2. Hash Comparison: IRBM calculates the hash of the e-Invoice XML and compares it with the decrypted hash value. If they match, the invoice is considered valid; otherwise, it is deemed invalid.\u3002", "top": 0, "createdAt": 1719475163, "style": "", "script": "", "ogImage": "https://github.githubassets.com/favicons/favicon.svg", "createdDate": "2024-06-27", "dateLabelColor": "#bc4c00"}, "P2": {"htmlDir": "docs/post/Business Proposal for Digital Certificate Sales for LHDN-IRB e-Invoice.html", "labels": ["documentation"], "postTitle": "Business Proposal for Digital Certificate Sales for LHDN/IRB e-Invoice", "postUrl": "post/Business%20Proposal%20for%20Digital%20Certificate%20Sales%20for%20LHDN-IRB%20e-Invoice.html", "postSourceUrl": "https://github.com/lihchyuan/einvoicedigitalcert/issues/2", "commentNum": 0, "wordCount": 2747, "description": "# Business Proposal for Digital Certificate Sales for LHDN/IRB e-Invoice\r\n\r\n## Executive Summary\r\nIn response to the increasing need for secure and compliant digital transactions with Lembaga Hasil Dalam Negeri (LHDN) / Inland Revenue Board (IRB) e-Invoice systems, we propose a comprehensive service offering digital certificates.
